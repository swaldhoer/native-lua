`Lua` is multi-paradigm programming language. `Lua` is cross-platform as it is
written in ANSI C. Lua is licensed under `MIT`_ license.

For information on `Lua` see `Lua.org`_.

********
Overview
********

As default `Lua` requires `gcc` and `make` to be installed to build the `Lua`
binaries, therefore building for e.g., Linux or other POSIX systems where `gcc`
and `make` are natively available is easy. Building `Lua` on Windows with
MinGWs' `gcc` and some sort of `make` is also straight forward.

But this does not allow a good platform and compiler independent way of building
and testing `Lua`, especially testing is not that simple as it should be.
Therefore this project tries to implement a platform and compiler independent
way of building **and** testing `Lua`.

******
How-To
******

Building `Lua` requires python 2.7 or greater and some C compiler.

.. code-block:: sh

  git clone https://github.com/swaldhoer/native-lua
  cd native-lua
  python waf configure

The output will show a number of successfully configured compilers, e.g., for
Windows with installed MSVC, gcc and clang the output should like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  ...
  Configured compilers                          : msvc, gcc, clang
  'configure' finished successfully

Now the build commands ``build_msvc``, ``build_gcc`` and ``build_clang`` should
work. The command concatenate is the same on all platforms, ``build_`` and then
the name of the successfully configured compiler.

.. code-block:: sh

  python waf build_gcc
  ...
  python waf install_gcc

For all build and test options on the platform see the output of

.. code-block:: sh

    python waf --help

******************************************
Repository Structure And Code Organization
******************************************

Root Directory
==============

The root directory contains the

- general project documentation and a changelog (``README.rst``,
  ``CHANGELOG.rst``)
- build script (``wscript``),
- CI scripts (``.appveyor.yml``, ``.cirrus.yml``, ``.travis.yml``,
  ``azure-pipelines.yml``),
- editor configurations (``.vscode``, ``.editorconfig``),
- coding and general guidelines (``.flake8``, ``.pylintrc``,
  ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``),
- licensing information (``LICENSE``, ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``),
- and information on the lua version (``LUA_VERSION``).

``docs`` Directory
==================

Project documentation. The documentation from the official `Lua` releases is
currently **not** included outside the ``dl`` directory. The man files
(``lua.1``, ``luac.1``) however are included in ``docs/man`` and ``docs/man1``.

``src`` Directory
=================

This directory contains the source files as they are downloaded from `Lua.org`_,
except that trailing whitespace and additional newlines at the end of the files
are removed.

``tests`` Directory
===================

This directory contains the test files as they are downloaded from `Lua.org`_,
except that trailing whitespace and additional newlines at the end of the files
are removed.

Furthermore for some tests, require changes to the test files in order to work
on platforms. The changes made to these files are indicated by the
following line:

.. code-block:: sh

    -- Added by 'native-lua' project, see https://github.com/swaldhoer/native-lua.
